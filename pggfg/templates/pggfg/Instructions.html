                In the beginning in a one-minute stage you will be asked to compute a series of additions.
                Your Preliminary Gains depend on how many correct answers you provide:
                you will get <strong>{{ Constants.fee }}</strong> for each correct answer.

                After that the group has the opportunity to undertake a joint project. Each participant in
                the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
                the project. Contribution could be any integer from 0
                to the entire amount of your Preliminary Gains.

                In the beginning of the <b>first</b> stage each round every participant in your group
                of {{ Constants.players_per_group }}
                receives <strong>{{ Constants.endowment|c }}</strong>. The group

            The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The
            contributions of all <strong>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}</strong> participants are
            added up, the total contribution
            is multiplied by a factor of <strong>{{ Constants.efficiency_factor }}</strong>, and the
            resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is
            evenly split among all <strong>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}</strong>
            participants. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus
            the amount you did not contribute.

            In the second stage you can see the decisions and other participants in the your group,
            You can transfer up to <strong>{{ Constants.punishment_endowment }} points </strong> from your endowment to
            decrease the
            income of these
            participants. By transferring 1 point from your endowment you decrease the income of another
            participant by {{ Constants.punishment_factor }} points.
